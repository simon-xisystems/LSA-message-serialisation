# Lean Service Architecture Message Serialisastion library

This has been forked from the main Apache Avro library in order to develop a standalone library for the serialisation and de-serialisation of Lean Service Architecture Messages. 

LSA uses a extended schema definition, therefore requiring a modified library to allow compatibility.
